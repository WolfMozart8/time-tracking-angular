## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - JS Framwork

### What I learned

I learned Angular (this is my first time) and i have noticed significant improvements in my TypeScript and CSS skills.


### Continued development

I encountered some issues with Angular components, especially those that use 'display: flex,' for example. I wasn't entirely sure how to correctly bind them with other components. To address this, I plan to work on more Angular projects to enhance my skills.
